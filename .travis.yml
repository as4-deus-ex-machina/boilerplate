# This configuration file will make Travis CI do the following:
# - download the latest source
# - install the code
# - run unit and integration tests
# - compile our article PDF(s) and force-push them back to the repository

# The PDF compilation hack is by Dan Foreman-Mackey, with modifications by Andy Casey.

# Travis needs to be provided with the environment variables:
# - GITHUB_USER:    your GitHub username
# - GITHUB_API_KEY: a personal access token - make sure that it has access to
#                   'repo' - https://github.com/settings/tokens

# Remember to go to Travis settings and set to only build if .travis.yml is present

  #        without using sudo then we can use Travis containers, which are
